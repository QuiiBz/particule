# Get Started

## Installation

Particule is shipped in `cjs` and `esm` formats. Install it with your favorite package manager:

```bash
npm install particule
yarn add particule
pnpm add particule
```

Particule uses the concept of **atoms** to manage the state. Each atom represent a piece of state, that can be read and updated from anywhere in your application.

## Create an atom

You can create basic atoms with the `atom` function, and we'll see later how to create more complex atoms with [`createAtom`](/advanced/hooks).

```tsx
import { atom } from 'atom'

export const textAtom = atom('Hello World')
```

The type of the atom is `Atom<string>`, and is automatically inferred from the type of the initial value. If you need more logic, you can also use a callback function for the initial value (and even make it [async with suspense](/features/suspense)):

```tsx
export const textAtom = atom(() => {
  // Extra logic here...
  return 'Hello World'
})
```

## Use the atom

You can now use this atom anywhere in your application using the `useAtom` hook (or more [fine-grained](/features/fine-grained) hooks). Similar to `useState`, `useAtom` returns a tuple with the current value and a function to update it.

```tsx
import { useAtom } from 'particule'

function App() {
  const [value, setValue] = useAtom(textAtom)

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{value}</h1>
      <button onClick={() => setValue('Updated!')}>
        Change text
      </button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

The `setValue` function can also accept a callback instead of a value. It takes one argument, which is the current value of the atom. Similar as the initial callback, you can make it [async with suspense](/features/suspense):

```tsx
<button onClick={() => setValue(currentValue => {
  // Extra logic here...
  return currentValue + ' - updated!'
})}>
  Change text
</button>
```

`setValue` also accepts a second argument, which is an object with options:
- `equal` an equality function that takes `a` and `b` and returns a boolean if they are equal. Defaults to `Object.is`
- `noSuspense` see [Async with Suspense](/features/async-suspense)

# `localStorage` helper

Helper atoms are created using [`createAtom`](/advanced/hooks). They are similar to the `atom` function, except that they add new functionality to the atom using [`hooks`](/advanced/hooks).

This `localStorage` helper can be used to create an atom that will be saved (and fetched if present) to the [`localStorage`](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage).

Start by creating the atom, providing a `key` for the item:

```tsx
import { localStorageAtom } from 'particule'

export const textAtom = localStorageAtom('mykey')('Hello World')
```

Use it the same way as you would with an atom:

```tsx
function App() {
  const [value, setValue] = useAtom(textAtom)

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{value}</h1>
      <button onClick={() => setValue('Updated!')}>
        Change text
      </button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

The atom will automatically use the value from `localStorage` if it exists, or use the initial value, and will be saved to `localStorage` when it changes.
